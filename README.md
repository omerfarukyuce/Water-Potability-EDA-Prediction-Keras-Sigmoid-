# ğŸŒŠ Water Quality and Potability Analysis

## ğŸ“œ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing water quality data to predict the potability of water. The dataset contains various physicochemical properties of water samples and is used to build a deep learning model for classification.

## ğŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/). It contains the following features:

- **ğŸ’§ `ph`**: pH level of the water
- **ğŸ’§ `Hardness`**: Hardness of the water
- **ğŸ’§ `Solids`**: Total dissolved solids
- **ğŸ’§ `Chloramines`**: Chloramine concentration
- **ğŸ’§ `Sulfate`**: Sulfate concentration
- **ğŸ’§ `Conductivity`**: Conductivity of the water
- **ğŸ’§ `Organic_carbon`**: Organic carbon content
- **ğŸ’§ `Trihalomethanes`**: Trihalomethanes concentration
- **ğŸ’§ `Turbidity`**: Turbidity of the water
- **ğŸš° `Potability`**: Target variable (0 = Not Potable, 1 = Potable)

## ğŸ“š Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
